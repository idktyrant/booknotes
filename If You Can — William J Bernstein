## The 3 Fund Strategy
* Save 15% of your salary every month and divide it into 3 parts — 
    1. a U.S. total stock market index fund
    2. an International total stock market index fund
    3. a U.S. total bond market index fund

* Over time the three funds will grow at different rates so once per year you'll adjust their amounts so that they're again equal.

## Prologue — points to remember
> Dieting and investing are both simple, but neither is easy.

## 5 Hurdles
### Hurdle 1 : People spend too much money. Don't.
* Don't spend on unnessesary things like the newest iPhone, fashionable clothes, fancy car, vacation, a latte per day ($100 a month) etc. you could, if you had to, not only live without , but also function better without.

* As bad as living with a roommate may be, it's not nearly as awful as living on cat food at age 70.

* It may happen people will *own* a lot but will not *have* a lot.

### Hurdle 2 : Gain an adequate understanding of finance.
* Essence of scientific finance is remarkably simple and can be acquired, if you know where to look, pretty easily.

* Differences between a **stock** and a **bond**.

* `Expected return` and `Risk aversion`

* No one has ever predicted market declines reliably. Don't even try it.

### Hurdle 3 : Learn the basics of financial and market history.
> Mark Twain : "History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme."

* Market history shows that when there's economic blue sky, future returns are low and when the economy is on the skids, future returns are high. The best fishing is done in the most stormy waters.

* High risk and high returns go hand in hand and so do low risk and low returns.

* Learning market history isn't just about knowing the past pattern of returns. In addition, it's about learning to recognize the market's emotional environment, which also correlates with future returns.

 * We often depend on the recommendations of others for entertainment media, restaurants, doctors but with finance, we should do the exact opposite. The entry of naive, inexperienced investors usually signals the end. Conversely, when everyone is afraid of stocks then there's no one left to sell, so prices are much more likely to move up than down.

### Hurdle 4 : Don't give in to your instincts.
* We've evolved to think about risk as a short-term phenomenon and are not designed to think about financial risk over its proper time horizon, which is several decades.

* Humans are "pattern seeking primates" who perceive relationships where in fact none exist.

### Hurdle 5 : Recognize the monsters in financial industry.
* Main goal for the average stock broker or financial advisor is to transfer your wealth to them and mutual fund companies exist to make profits for their owners, not you.

* Stock brokers do not owe their clients "fiduciary duty" — the obligation that most other professionals have to put their clients' interests above their own.

* Act as if every broker, insurance salesman, mutual fund salesperson, and financial advisor you encounter is a hardened criminal, and stick to low-cost index funds and you'll do just fine.

### FINAL CHECKLIST
- [ ] Get rid of all your debt. Student loan, car loan, everything.
- [ ] Create and emergency fund placed in a taxable account for **six** months of living expenses.
- [ ] Start saving for retirement — goal is to save at least 15 percent of your salary but in reality, the best strategy is to save as much as you can, and don't stop doing so until the day you die.
- [ ] Create the 3 funds as described, rebalance them every year back to equal. 
- [ ] Avoid selling stocks in a taxable account, since this will incur capital gains taxes. 
- [ ] Check expenses for your retirement fund. They should be low.
